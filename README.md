# GoTrainning

Compilation of all of the excercises being solved during the training.

## Packages

There are three folders according to the following:
```
src
 |-- crackingcodinginterview
 |-- hackerrank
 +-- onthego
```
All of them contains exercises requested from the book Cracking the Coding Interview, exercises requested from HackerRank (on the presentation) and additional exercises requested during the training.

## Time complexity

Here we go, trying to get the time complexities from our solutions... 

### Cracking the Coding Interview

#### Chapter 1 - Arrays and Strings
   1. UniqueCharacters.java - Sol 1: Complexity `O(n)` Sol 2: Complexity `O(n)` Sol 3: Complexity `O(n!)`
   2. ReverseCStyleString.java - Complexity `O(n)`
   3. RemoveDuplicateCharacters.java - Complexity `O(n * m^2)`
   4. Anagrams.java - Complexity `O(n) + O(2(n * log2(n))) = O(n * log2(n))`
   5. ReplaceSpaces.java - Complexity `O(n)`
   6. RotateMatrix.java - Complexity `O(n)` - [ ] TODO
   8. RotationWithSubstring.java - Complexity `O(n)`
  
#### Chapter 2 - Linked Lists
